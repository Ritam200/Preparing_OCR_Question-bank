# Preparing_OCR_Question-bank
# 📘 Preparing a Question Bank using OCR

This project automates the extraction, analysis, and classification of exam questions from scanned documents (PDF or image format) using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It maps each question to the appropriate subject, unit, semester, and course outcome based on the official Jadavpur University IT syllabus. The application provides a simple UI using Streamlit and stores processed data in an SQLite database for future access.
